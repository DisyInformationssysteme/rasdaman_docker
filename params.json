If not yet done, install Docker, e.g. by `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io` or similar depending on your OS.\r\n2. Download the source e.g. by `git clone https://github.com/mappl/rasdaman_docker` \r\n3. Make relevant scripts executable `chmod +x install.sh start.sh stop.sh`.\r\n4. If you do not want to use the default settings for docker image and container names, hostnames, and port mapping, you may want to edit the docker run command in install.sh\r\n5. Run `sudo ./install.sh`.\r\n6. The image will be built and a corresponding container will be created automatically. The container will be started automatically but might still need some seconds for first time initializations (e.g. web application deployment). You can now start and stop the container whenever you like via `sudo ./start.sh` and `sudo ./stop.sh` respectively.\r\n7. Once started, you can log in to the container via ssh using `ssh -p 21210 rasdaman@localhost`. Default password is \"rasdaman\".\r\n8. From the host machine, try to access the Petascope interface or RStudio using the URL `http://localhost:21211/rasdaman/ows` and `http://localhost:21215/` respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\nThis is a preliminary version, open issues include the following:\r\n- Rasgeo extension currently not working as it cannot connect to file system storage\r\n- Rasdaman server configuration is not yet editable as install.sh arguments\r\n- Docker run parameters like port mappings, hostnames, and mounted volumes are not yet editable as install.sh arguments\r\n- Data directory of BLOBS is currently not accessible for the host system\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
